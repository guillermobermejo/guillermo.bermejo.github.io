						<p>
							My dive into computer science and introduction to programming occurred in 2015 while in pursuit of an 
							associate degree in liberal arts and mathematics. From experience, I knew that mathematics required 
							a high level of critical thinking, critical analysis and problem solving skills in order to be 
							successful, three qualities I exhibit, especially so when going through the process of learning something 
							new. My true passion lies in continuously learning new things be it instruments, concepts, technologies 
							or even languages and am naturally a very hands-on type of guy. This is why in my journey of pursuing 
							an associate degree, I learned that while mathematics satisfied me my true satisfaction came from the 
							process of problem solving itself, I desired a means to apply my skills at a more technical level, 
							which led me to computer science and development. 
						</p>
                        <p>
                            Through computer science, I discovered that what I sought after was collaboration, creation and innovation 
							through the <i>application</i> of problem solving, critical thinking and optimization analysis. I learned how powerful
							programming can be and immediately desired to develop my skills out of a desire to contribute to making a 
							positive change. What transpired from this decision was a transition into computer science and ultimately 
							led me to earn an associate of science in computer science. Fast forward to today, currently I am nearing 
							completion of my Bachelor of Science in computer science at Stony Brook University.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have become familiar with quite a few programming languages from different programming paradigms including 
							Java, Python, C and Ocaml. From the front-end I have become familiar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and React.js, 
							and from the back-end with technologies such as Node.js, Express and Axios as well as worked with an SQL database
                            in MySQL and a NoSQL database in MongoDB experienceing the benefits and tradeoffs of each. I have worked in a 
							four-man team in developing a full-stack web application as part of an upper-division course CSE416, in which I 
							had the role of a front-end developer and have seen how technologies of a full-stack web application work in tangent
                            with each other. This project is listed as 'Political Gerrymandering State Analyzer' in the projects section. 
							Through the shared passion of my team and I, we finished 1st in the concept phase, design phase, implementation 
							phase and final showcase phase out of 7 teams.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently I am seeking a software engineering internship opportunity to further understand the process of 
							development and especially learn from working with a team within the industry and come with a desire to make 
							an impact. This burning desire of mine to learn and contribute to making a positive change not just to the 
							individual but in a global sense through software development will allow me to go above and beyond and excel 
							as a software engineer.
                        </p>
